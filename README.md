# App Search

This app is a very barebones demo of some split testing done during a tech talk at NCDevCon by Daniel Hammond on 9/30/2012

# Instructions

In order to make the app work you will need to create an account and an application at Parse. Both are free and more information is available at http://parse.com

Once you do that and run the app with your key in there it will create the experiment class, you will want to create a column for the buttonTitle and then add rows for each test case. Outside of that it should work out of the box.
